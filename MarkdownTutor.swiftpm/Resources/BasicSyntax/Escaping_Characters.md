# Escaping Characters

To display a literal character that would otherwise be used to format text in a Markdown document, add a backslash (\) in front of the character.

`\* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.`

The rendered output looks like this:

\* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.
