## Horizontal Rule Best Practices

For compatibility, put blank lines before and after horizontal rules.

| ✅  Do this | ❌  Don't do this |
| --- | --- |
| Try to put a blank line before...<br><br>\-\-\-<br><br>...and after a horizontal rule. | Without blank lines, this would be a heading.<br>\-\-\-<br>Don't do this! |
