# Emphasis

> ### All Rendered Output will display below Markdown and HTML

You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic.

## Bold

To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

| Markdown | HTML | 
| --- | --- |
| I just love \*\*bold text\*\*. | I just love <strong>bold text</strong>. |

I just love **bold text**.

| Markdown | HTML | 
| --- | --- |
| I just love \_\_bold text\_\_. | I just love <strong>bold text</strong>. |

I just love __bold text__.

| Love\*\*is\*\*bold | Love<strong>is</strong>bold |

Love**is**bold


## Bold Best Practices

Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle underscores in the middle of a word. For compatibility, use asterisks to bold the middle of a word for emphasis.
