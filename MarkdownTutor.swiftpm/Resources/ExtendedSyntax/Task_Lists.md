# Task Lists

Task lists (also referred to as checklists and todo lists) allow you to create a list of items with checkboxes. In Markdown applications that support task lists, checkboxes will be displayed next to the content. To create a task list, add dashes (-) and brackets with a space ([ ]) in front of task list items. To select a checkbox, add an x in between the brackets ([x]).

```

The rendered output looks like this:

- [x] Write the press release
