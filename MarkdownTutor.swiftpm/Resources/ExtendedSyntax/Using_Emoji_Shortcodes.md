# Using Emoji Shortcodes

Some Markdown applications allow you to insert emoji by typing emoji shortcodes. These begin and end with a colon and include the name of an emoji.

```
Gone camping! :tent: Be back soon.

That is so funny! :joy:
```

The rendered output looks like this:

Gone camping! â›º Be back soon.

That is so funny! ðŸ˜‚
