# Superscript

This isnâ€™t common, but some Markdown processors allow you to use superscript to position one or more characters slightly above the normal line of type. To create a superscript, use one caret symbol (^) before and after the characters.

`X^2^`

Alternatively, if your Markdown application supports **HTML**, you can use the sup HTML tag.

`X<sup>2</sup>`
