# Highlight

This isnâ€™t common, but some Markdown processors allow you to highlight text. The result looks like this. To highlight words, use two equal signs (==) before and after the words.

`I need to highlight these ==very important words==.`

Alternatively, if your Markdown application supports HTML, you can use the mark **HTML** tag.

`I need to highlight these <mark>very important words</mark>.`
