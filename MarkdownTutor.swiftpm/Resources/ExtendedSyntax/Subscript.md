# Subscript

This isnâ€™t common, but some Markdown processors allow you to use subscript to position one or more characters slightly below the normal line of type. To create a subscript, use one tilde symbol (~) before and after the characters.

`H~2~O`

Alternatively, if your Markdown application supports **HTML**, you can use the sub HTML tag.

H<sub>2</sub>O
